      <h3 class="post-title">Lockdown Lesson 1: Embracing Vulnerability</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>About 12 years ago I told someone close to me that eventually, I wanted to work within global brands and effectively work my way up to become a Brand Director of a leading drinks company. The response I received to my dream job was that ‘they don’t hire people like me for jobs like that’ and then and there, my bubble was burst and my dream evaporated. I was hurt, I felt stupid, vulnerable and subsequently, my need for validation in my work increased as I felt like an imposter.</p>
        <p>Fast forward to 2019 and I was happily ensconced in a permanent role with a young pub company where I lead all of our brand partnerships & activations as well as being responsible for the sales & marketing function across the group and I started to see that perhaps my little dream from all those years ago might actually be a possibility. </p>

        <p>If somebody would have told me a week ago that I would be able to make a <strong>website</strong>, I would not have believed them.</p>
        <p>Just a few days later, I came across <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a> and started to work on a <em>real</em> blog.</p>
